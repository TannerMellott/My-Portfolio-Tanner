<h1>A little About Me</h1>
<p>A little more about me, Im extremly Competitive and I want to be the aboslute best 
    at everthing I do. This is were my love for Competitive Call of Duty growing up
    I alwayed played sports then I found my love for call of duty from my cousin
    I used to be at his house all the time so I would randomly play. He said that 
    I was really good for never playing and should think about getting a xbox 360.
    so I did and started playing GameBattles which is a Competitive game for anybody. I 
    went to my first ever lan tournament in Iowa City where there was 10 teams they were 
    all college kids and after playing we got 7th place but me and my cousin got a lot of
    hype as you could say from the older guys for being good. 
</p>
<p>Fast forward 4 years later I broke my wrist and my pinking finger which most gamers
    know that the pinky holds the grip of the controller and tried playing again and 
    after a couple hours my wrist is hurting and cramping and decided to code and hopes
    to get to a Call of Duty company and make games in hopes to continue my passion.
